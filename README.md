# IBM Data Science Capstone<br>
Commercial space travel is fully here and SpaceX is at the forefront of this endeavor. While other commercial manned space missions are upwards of 165 million dollars, SpaceX is able to undercut the competition significantly with a cost of 62 million dollars.
SpaceX is able to keep these costs low because oftentimes they are able to recover the first stage of the rocket. However, under certain circumstances they are not able to recover the first stage due to payload, orbit or customer.
In this project, I take on the role of Data Scientist for a fictional start-up SpaceY. My task is to determine the price of each launch by gathering information about SpaceX. Also, I will determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage by training a machine learning model with publicly available information to make these predictions.<br><br>
